# Highjack: Innovative Smoking Cessation Solution for College Students

**Problem Statement**
Nicotine addiction and elevated stress levels among college students lead to significant health risks and barriers to quitting smoking. Traditional cessation methods often fail to address the unique challenges faced by this demographic.

**Proposed Solution: Highjack**
Highjack is a multifaceted smoking cessation solution designed specifically for college students, integrating:
A nicotine-free herbal inhalation device
An AI-powered mobile app with a personalized assistant (Fema)
Tailored stress-relief interventions across four categories: movement, laughter, socializing, and mindfulness

**Key Technologies and Techniques**

Herbal vape hardware
Voice-activated AI assistant powered by LLMs
Machine learning algorithms for predicting high-risk moments
Personalized stress-relief activity suggestions
Community support and gamification elements

**Theoretical Framework**
Highjack is based on the Health Belief Model (HBM), addressing key aspects such as perceived susceptibility, perceived barriers, and self-efficacy.

**Evaluation Plan**
Randomized Controlled Trial (RCT)
Primary outcome: Success rate of smoking cessation
Secondary outcomes: Stress levels, user satisfaction, engagement metrics
Data collection at baseline, 3 months, 6 months, and 12 months

**Scientific Significance**

Integration of herbal alternatives with AI-powered personalized interventions
Potential insights into the efficacy of "habit hijacking" for behavioral change
Advancement in understanding the role of AI in addiction management

**Societal Impact**

Potential reduction in smoking rates among college students
Promotion of healthier stress management techniques
Possible broader applications for other forms of addiction
